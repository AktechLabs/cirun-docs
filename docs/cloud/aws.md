# Amazon Web Services

If you're using AWS as a cloud provider for Cirun, this is how you would give
Cirun access to your AWS, for it to be able to create runners.

- Create an IAM account to EC2Admin Permissions
- Generate an "Access Key" and "Secret Key" for that IAM user
- Paste your "Access Key" and "Secret Key" in the "Cloud" Tab of Cirun Dashboard under AWS section.
