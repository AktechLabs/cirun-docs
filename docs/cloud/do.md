# DigitalOcean

If you're using DigitalOcean as a cloud provider for Cirun, this is how you would give
Cirun access to your DigitalOcean, for it to be able to create runners.


Just click on Connect DigitalOcean button in the Cloud in the Cirun Dashboard.

:::caution
DigitalOcean charges you hourly unlike other cloud providers like say AWS. So irrespective of how long you
use the machine for 1 min or 59 min, the charge will be same, so unless your jobs are long enough, DigitalOcean
is not very economical.
